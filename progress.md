Plan: docs/plans/2026-11-02-unexpected-v8-single-command-center.md

Task 1: completed
- Desktop command-center shell and same-origin read APIs implemented.
- Authenticated reads, static-asset traversal protection, and explicit /mobile/ 404 verified.

Task 2: openox_configured_unverified; provider_diagnostics_deployed
- Native Anthropic, OpenAI/OpenRouter Chat Completions, and OpenOx Responses API adapters implemented. OpenOx route is registered only when OPENOX_API_KEY is present; it defaults to gpt-6-astra and remains unverified until the bounded provider test succeeds.
- Per-task route selection remains immutable across concurrent requests and full lifecycle stages.
- Bounded live provider-test endpoint and provider provenance audit events implemented.
- Provider route, concurrent routing, coordinator, lifecycle and HTTP tests pass.
- Render v8 is configured with OPENOX_BASE_URL=https://api.openoxai.com/v1, OPENOX_MODEL=gpt-6-astra and UNEXPECTED_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=openox. Live /health reports provider=openox and provider_configured=true; a non-empty key is configured, but its validity and model entitlements are not yet verified. Seven authenticated OpenOx Test connection attempts on 2026-11-02 14:43–14:45 UTC failed as ProviderError; earlier code omitted upstream status/body. Deployment 1cfa531 now exposes a bounded upstream HTTP status, error code and message with API-key redaction. Retest is required to identify the exact cause; lifecycle remains gated until verified=true.

Task 3: adapter_and_manual_branch_recovery_verified; scheduled_backup_pending
- PostgreSQL StateStore adapter, PostgreSQL idempotency mixin, and PostgreSQL one-use approval ledger implemented.
- Fresh-database migrations 001 and 002 and Python psycopg adapter are exercised in ephemeral PostgreSQL 16 CI.
- Neon branch v8-migration-test (br-young-resonance-b9unjqzy) has migration 002 applied and verified; duplicate idempotency and approval consumption are rejected.
- Manual Neon branch-recovery test passed with isolated test rows only.
- New Render v8 runtime returned /health HTTP 200 with storage=ready, verifying a live database query.
- Original Neon main branch remains at schema version 1; no production schema was changed.
- Remaining: establish scheduled/manual backup policy and restore rehearsal on actual runtime data.

Task 4: desktop_command_center_live; authenticated_browser_session_pending
- Task submission, task detail, task/event history, provider status/selection/testing, capabilities, governance visibility and improvement proposal controls are connected to the same Coordinator/API.
- GitHub Actions full HTTP integration verifies health, authentication, all 38 agents, task invocation, task detail, provider provenance, idempotent replay, desktop UI and /mobile/ 404.
- Public live checks on the v8 service:
  * /health HTTP 200, version=8.0.0-preview, storage=ready, authentication_configured=true, privileged_actions=fail-closed.
  * / HTTP 200, title uneXpected — Command Center.
  * /assets/app.js HTTP 200.
  * /assets/styles.css HTTP 200.
  * /mobile/ HTTP 404.
- Owner-authenticated provider-test calls were recorded in the hosted PostgreSQL event log. The runtime bearer token remains in Render private settings and is never requested in chat.
- Promotion, rollback and privileged approval actions are not exposed.

Task 5: single_service_live; final_manual_settings_pending
- Single-process Python Dockerfile copies all manifest-pinned skill sources, including self_improvement/.
- Latest GitHub Actions run 41466139862 passed **197 tests, 1 skipped**, real PostgreSQL integration, Docker build, actual container smoke test (health, UI, auth, 38 agents, task invocation) and CLI smoke tests.
- New Render service: unexpected-v8-command-center (srv-dbk8217b9u1s73ftauig), free Frankfurt, branch feat/unified-v8-foundation, auto-deploy disabled.
- Latest v8 deployment dep-dbka85fb9u1s7383fkqg is live at commit 1cfa531b2feef9dd4533617f06cca8d72e17b080, adding safe provider-test diagnostics.
- DATABASE_URL for isolated Neon v8-migration-test branch and a 96-character access token are stored directly in Render private environment settings.
- Render v8 Health Check Path is configured as /health and read back from the service configuration.
- OpenOx is the configured default route and /health reports provider_configured=true; successful live verification has not yet passed. The full lifecycle is server-side blocked until the selected provider is verified.
- Existing AI Studio, v7.3.1 runtime test and old v8 unified test services are untouched pending cutover acceptance.

Execution boundary:
- Work remains on feat/unified-v8-foundation; PR #11 remains draft and is not merged.
- The v8 service's non-secret provider settings and health-check path were updated. No secret values were read or exposed. Older Render services and the parent Neon main schema remain untouched.
- New v8 Render service uses isolated Neon test branch, not the parent branch.
- Phone/PWA is excluded from v8. Legacy source is retained only for rollback.
- Consequential actions remain disabled until durable approval, replay, backup and restore gates pass and the owner separately approves activation.


## Resource Intelligence and AI Quality Evaluation

Plan: docs/plans/2026-11-02-resource-intelligence-ai-quality-evaluation.md
Specification: docs/specs/2026-11-02-resource-intelligence-ai-quality-evaluation-design.md

Task 1 — Resource Intelligence: implementation present; focused registry tests passed in GitHub Actions run 41501399827. Catalog is read-only and Awesome-linked candidates remain discovered/unverified. CLI and authenticated GET API added.

Task 2 — AI Quality Evaluation: implementation present; fixture-backed Coordinator tests passed in GitHub Actions run 41501399827. Runner requires an explicit configured/verified non-mock provider for live use; fixture mode is restricted to internal tests. Reports store checks and output digests, not raw output.

Task 3 — API and command center: authenticated resource and quality history APIs, bounded quality POST, and the existing single-app Intelligence view are implemented. API/UI regression tests passed in run 41501399827. Live provider evaluation has not been run.

Task 4 — Current verification: GitHub Actions run 41501399827 (commit a83216de80fa8f028871adc55482013ed8625b55) reached the regression suite. All tests passed except the expected optional v6 fixture skip; the only reported failure was the SHA-256 inventory mismatch caused by new/changed tracked files. Inventory, CLI smoke, latest-head CI and final read-back remain to complete.

Safety: no external candidate project installed; no paid package or service; no new role; no new database migration; no Render deployment; no PR merge; no old service retirement; consequential execution remains fail-closed.
